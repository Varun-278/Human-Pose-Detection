# Human Pose Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview  
This project implements human pose estimation using deep learning models such as YOLOv7, MoveNet, and OpenPose to detect keypoints of the human body for real-time posture and gesture analysis.

## Features  
- Detects major body keypoints (e.g., shoulders, knees, elbows) from images and videos  
- Compares the performance of YOLOv7, MoveNet, and OpenPose  
- Visualizes detected poses on image and video inputs  
- Real-time inference support for webcam and video streams  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- PyTorch  
- TensorFlow  
- YOLOv7  
- MoveNet  
- OpenPose
